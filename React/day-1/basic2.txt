Package.json => contains project configration i.e project name, project version, is Private or not.

src => entry file (index.js)



in a specific file we get optionally 3 things 

import 
    => using import we can use other functionality and libraries.
       when we import something by default its a Object.   (core rule of JS and node JS)


function/class

export
    => we can export object/ string/ function/ number/ Array/ class 
       when we import something at the time of import it comes inside object automatically.  (core rule of JS and node JS)


In React we don't use real DOM but we use VDOM (Virtual DOM)


App.js => IS a component 
        : Basic building block 
        : must start with capital latter.
        : component is always exported.  
        : In one file you may have multiple component.

In React there are 2 types of extensions we use .js and .jsx

Every component has 3 parts 
1. Import (optional)
2. functional/ class 
3. export

class =>  Component created by Class are called class component.    
          It contains render() function in which we return value.
 
function => Component created by function are called functional component. 
            It must have return keyword.
            In return is not a html element.
            It is JSX ==> Javascript XML
            JSX rules :
                # JSX will always have one parent element.
                # If you don't want to use JS element you can use <></> i.e JSX fragment.
                # class attribute used in it must be className
                # for attribute in form should br htmlFor
                # if you want to use javascript code ==> { js code } 
                # if else are only possible by ternery operator =>  (condition) ? true : false ;
                # loop we use map method of array 
                # style="background-color : red; color : green" ==> style = {{ background-color : 'red', color = 'green' }}
