If we want to use loop in react we use a map method of array.

when we use loop in react this loop creates runtime list, to identify this list react needs a "Key" property, to make perfect comparison between previous and new.
In project we use key to <li> element as key - {index} here index is a unique value assigned by map function.

In react for "if ... else " we use ternery operator ==> (condition) ? Truecode : Falsecode
